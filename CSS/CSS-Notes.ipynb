    " - What Is CSS ?\n",
    "\n",
    "     - CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It's a language used to style HTML elements. \n",
    "     \n",
    "     - it enhances the visual appearance of a website, allowing you to control layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and more\n",

    " - How to Embed a CSS Code to a Page ? \n",
    "\n",
    "     1) Inline CSS : \n",
    "\n",
    "     - add CSS directly to individual HTML elements using the **style** attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "         ```html\n",
    "         <p style=\"color: blue;\">Inline Styling</p>\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     - This Method is The Strongest one But, it is less efficient for large websites but can be useful for quick, one-off styles \n",
    "\n",
    "     2) Internal CSS : \n",
    "\n",
    "     - This method embeds the CSS directly within the HTML document using the ```<style>``` tag inside the ```<head>``` section\n",
    "\n",
    "         ```html\n",
    "         <html>\n",

    "     3) External CSS : \n",

    "         \n",
    "     - It could target elements by tag name, class, ID, or more specific combinations\n",
    "\n",

    "     - Grouping Selectors Allows us to apply the same styles to several elements without having to write duplicate CSS rules Instead of repeating the same styles for each selector\n",

    "\n",
    " 1) **```font-family``` Property :**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Defines the typeface that should be applied to the text\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can provide a list of fonts, from which the browser will choose the first available one\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Example :**\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```css\n",
    "      p {\n",
    "          font-family: \"Arial\", \"Helvetic\", sans-serif;\n",

    " - Determines the size of the text. You can use different units such as ```px```, ```em```, ```%```, ```rem```, ```vw```\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Pixels (px) :**\n",
